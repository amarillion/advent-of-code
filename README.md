# Advent of Code

My solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## How to run C++

C++ solutions use the Clang "shebang" line so you can run them as script.
With clang installed, just do

```
cd 2022/day4
./solution.cpp
```

## How to run D

Some solutions use the [programming language D](https://dlang.org/).

To run a solution, with D installed, just do

```
cd 2021/day4
./solution.d
```

or 

```
cd 2021/day4
rdmd solution.d
```

Each script is self-compiling thanks to [rdmd](https://dlang.org/rdmd.html).
